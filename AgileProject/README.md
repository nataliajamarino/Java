## Agile GMIT Final Project

A project with a small Insurance program, focusing in the unit tests, the original code was difficult to test as everything was inside a few functions, in order to be better testable some changes were needed.

# Running the tests

There's a RunnerTest class that run the unit tests by JUnit.

```sh
cd src/ && javac -cp ie/gmit/dip/*.java
```

And then can start the application by running the Runner class:

```sh
java ie.gmit.dip.RunnerTest
```
